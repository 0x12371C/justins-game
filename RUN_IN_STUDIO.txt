GitHub + Studio quick start (new main repo):

Repo:
- https://github.com/0x12371C/justins-game

1) One-command workflow (recommended)
   cd C:\Users\Josh\OneDrive\Desktop\frontiergame
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-studio-workflow.ps1 -Branch main

2) Setup-only mode (no Studio auto-launch, no Rojo serve window)
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-studio-workflow.ps1 -Branch main -SkipRojoServe -SkipStudioLaunch

3) Manual setup path (if needed)
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\setup-dev-env.ps1 -Branch main

4) Start Rojo manually (only needed if you did setup-only mode)
   rojo serve

5) Open Roblox Studio + Rojo plugin
   - Connect to localhost:34872
   - Open project: C:\Users\Josh\OneDrive\Desktop\frontiergame\default.project.json

6) Play test
   - Currency HUD script: src\client\FrontierCurrencyUi.client.lua
   - Fishing UI script: src\client\FishingUi.client.lua
   - Fishing inventory bootstrap: src\server\FishingInventory.server.lua

Collab branch workflow:
- Create branch:
  git checkout -b feature/my-task
- Push branch:
  git push -u origin feature/my-task
- Open PR into main and merge after review.
- After merge, both sync:
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main

Fishing UI behavior (current):
- UI only appears when a fishing pole is equipped and activated.
- Tool is identified by:
  - Tool attribute IsFishingPole = true (preferred), or
  - Name containing fish + pole/rod.

Inventory behavior (current):
- Backpack CoreGui is forced on by src\client\CoreGuiBackpack.client.lua
- Players get a Fishing Pole from src\server\FishingInventory.server.lua

Required docking protocol:
- Follow DOCKING_HANDSHAKE.md after every commit.
